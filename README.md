# Urler ðŸ”Ž

Urler is a blazing-fast and versatile search engine toolkit currently under construction. With its multi-search engine capability, it allows you to effortlessly search through multiple engines simultaneously, saving you time and effort. The unique feature of Urler is its ability to store and enhance discovered URLs based on customizable tags or keywords. This enables you to curate and refine your search results, making it an invaluable tool for researchers, developers, and sec enthusiasts. Stay tuned for exciting updates as we continue to build and improve Urler!

## Requirements :clock1:
- While the tool isn't 100% ready yet, you gotta roll with the iex, the cool Elixir REPL, for now!

## Usage (via docker)
```
$ chmod +x start.sh
$ ./start.sh

iex> UrlerSvc.bing_search("use some dork")
```
